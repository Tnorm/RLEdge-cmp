# Introduction
## Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is a subarea of machine learning where an agent learns to do tasks by learning and acting in an interactive environment. It had a great progress during the past few years due to the applicability of deep neural network models in this are. In deep reinforcement learning (DRL) we model the "brain" of the agent with a neural network. The agent interacts with the environment and the weights of this neural network are being updated. DRL models are generally optimized using policy gradient, or actor-critic methods. We are not going to discuss this area more here, since the project purpose just needs a basic understanding of deep reinforcement learning.
## Edge Computing
Huge usage of the cloud comptuing, growth of internet, and accordingly the need for more bandwith and less latency are principal causes of the recently introduced concept, edge computing. Edge computing is the practice of bringing and processing data at the edge of the network, rather than the cloud itself. There are a lots of applications and potential future usage that can be further optimized using edge computing. An application which motivates this project is the Amazon's Prime Air project. In this project, amazon's drone are automatically deliver packages to the customers. Inspired by this project and the potential applicability of DRL as the brain of these drones in the future, we are motivated to designing an efficient and well hardware optimized system for this package delivery or any similar robotic system. 


# Problem Definition and The Proposed approach
The purpose of the project is to design an energy efficient system for DRL agents that leverages both the cloud and the network edge. During the whole project we consider the Amazon's Prime Air scheme as a key potential application.
We design a very basic
